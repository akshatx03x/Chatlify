Chatlify 💬

A real-time chat application built with the MERN stack, featuring a clean and modern UI powered by DaisyUI. Chatlify is completely encrypted, supports image uploads via Cloudinary, and comes with several real-life features to enhance communication.

This project helped me dive deep into core MERN concepts like authentication, real-time communication, database handling, and clean UI development. It took me around 15 days to build from scratch 🚀.
